Using [Gedmo.Translatable](https://github.com/Atlantic18/DoctrineExtensions/blob/master/doc/translatable.md) in the Neos Flow framework proved a little harder than originally anticipated. This small package wraps up the necessary steps.


## Getting started

Just include this package, and then use Gedmo Translatable as explained in their documentation (e.g. using
the @Gedmo\Translatable annotation): https://github.com/Atlantic18/DoctrineExtensions/blob/master/doc/translatable.md

Make sure to clear the code cache completely in Data/Temporary after installing this package!

Furthermore, make sure to create a *doctrine migration* which creates the ext_translations SQL table; e.g. run `./flow doctrine:migrationgenerate`

**Check out the example package at https://github.com/sandstorm/GedmoTest**.

This connector supports all the advanced options provided by Gedmo Translatable.

### Model Annotations

Just annotate your model properties which shall be localized with `Gedmo\Mapping\Annotation\Translatable`.

```
    /**
     * @var string
     * @Gedmo\Translatable
     */
    protected $title;
```

### Translating a model (low-level)

```
    /**
     * Doctrine's Entity Manager. Note that "ObjectManager" is the name of the related interface.
     *
     * @Flow\Inject
     * @var ObjectManager
     */
    protected $entityManager;

    public function updateAction(Event $event) {
        /* @var $repository TranslationRepository */
        $repository = $this->entityManager->getRepository('Gedmo\\Translatable\\Entity\\Translation');
        $repository->translate($event, 'name', 'de', 'Deutscher Titel');
    }
```

### Set current language

In order to set the current language for *viewing*, inject the `Gedmo\Translatable\TranslatableListener` class and set
the current language on it: `$translatableListener->setTranslatableLocale('de');`.

## Translation management

### Editing multiple languages at the same time

* Mix-in the Trait `Sandstorm\GedmoTranslatableConnector\TranslatableTrait` and implement `\Sandstorm\GedmoTranslatableConnector\Translatable` into your model, e.g. by doing:

```
/**
 * @Flow\Entity
 */
class MyModel implements \Sandstorm\GedmoTranslatableConnector\Translatable {
  use \Sandstorm\GedmoTranslatableConnector\TranslatableTrait;
  
  // make sure some properties have Gedmo\Translatable annotations
}
```

* This trait adds a `getTranslations()` and `setTranslations()` method, allowing to get and set other translations of
  a model.
  
* Now, you can easily edit multiple languages by binding the form element to `translations.[language].[fieldname]`, e.g.
  this works like the following:

```
Name (default): <f:form.textfield property="name" /><br />
Name (de): <f:form.textfield property="translations.de.name" /><br />
Name (en): <f:form.textfield property="translations.en.name" /><br />
```

### Persist edited translations

With the by default enabled `instantTranslation` setting, the translations are updated and persisted through the `Gedmo\Translatable\Entity\Repository\TranslationRepository` immediately when calling the `setTranslation` method.
Often, this might not be ideal because it persists the entity right away. Disable the setting and call the `flush()` method of the `TranslatableManager` to persist the changes according to your needs.

### Fetching an object in another locale

If you have loaded an object in a specific locale, but later on need to change the object to be in another locale,
the method `reloadInLocale($locale)` (which is defined inside the trait `Sandstorm\GedmoTranslatableConnector\TranslatableTrait`)
can be called:

```
$myModel->getName(); // will return the language which was set at the time where $myModel was fetched

$myModel->reloadInLocale('de');
$myModel->getName(); // will return *german*
```

## Translating associations

**Warning: this feature is not yet 100% stable; please test it and give feedback!**

Normally, associations towards other domain models such as images or assets are not translation-aware; but Translatable
only works for simple properties.

The TranslatableConnector however contains some functionality to make translation of associations work; by using a
little workaround: **We store the identifier of the target object in the domain model, and manually load/store from this
identifier**.

This works as follows:

1. Makes sure you have the `TranslatableTrait` added to your domain class

2. e.g. to make an `Asset` reference translatable, create a new property `assetIdentifer` which is a string and will
   contain the asset identifier. This property should be marked as `Gedmo\Translatable`.

3. Then, you need to configure the `translationAssociationMapping`, which tells the system that the (virtual) property
   should `asset` should internally be stored as `assetIdentifier`.

4. Furthermore, create `assetOnSave` and `assetOnLoad` methods as outlined below, which convert the different representations

See the full example below:

```
class Event {
    use TranslatableTrait;
    
    /**
     * @var array
     * @Flow\Transient
     */
    protected $translationAssociationMapping = array(
        'assetIdentifier' => 'asset'
    );
    
    /**
     * @Gedmo\Translatable
     * @var string
     */
    protected $assetIdentifier;

    /**
     * @Flow\Inject
     * @var AssetRepository
     */
    protected $assetRepository;

    /**
     * @Flow\Inject
     * @var PersistenceManagerInterface
     */
    protected $persistenceManager;

    /**
     * @Flow\Inject
     * @var PropertyMapper
     */
    protected $propertyMapper;


    /**
     * @return \Neos\Media\Domain\Model\Asset
     */
    public function getAsset() {
        return $this->assetOnLoad($this->assetIdentifier);
    }

    /**
     * !!! This accepts the raw array as the user uploaded it; as we need to trigger the property mapper inside
     *     assetOnSave manually.
     *
     * @param array $asset
     */
    public function setAsset($asset) {
        $this->assetIdentifier = $this->assetOnSave($asset);
    }

    /**
     * This method is called in two places:
     * - inside setAsset()
     * - automatically by the TranslatableTrait
     * 
     * @param array $asset
     */
    public function assetOnSave($asset) {
        $asset = $this->propertyMapper->convert($asset, 'Neos\Media\Domain\Model\AssetInterface');
        if ($asset === NULL) {
            $this->assetRepository->remove($asset);
            return NULL;
        } elseif ($this->persistenceManager->isNewObject($asset)) {
            $this->assetRepository->add($asset);
            return $this->persistenceManager->getIdentifierByObject($asset);
        } else {
            $this->assetRepository->update($asset);
            return $this->persistenceManager->getIdentifierByObject($asset);
        }
    }

    /**
     * This method is called in two places:
     * - inside getAsset()
     * - automatically by the TranslatableTrait
     * 
     * @param array $asset
     */
    public function assetOnLoad($assetIdentifier) {
        return $this->assetRepository->findByIdentifier($assetIdentifier);
    }
}
```   


## Inner Workings

(as a further reference -- could also be reduced if we change Flow Framework a little on the relevant parts)

* Settings.yaml: Ignore Gedmo namespace from Reflection, adds the Translatable Listener as Doctrine Event listener.
  This part is pretty standard for using other Gedmo Doctrine extensions as well.
  
* Objects.yaml: Mark the `TranslatableListener` as singleton, such that you can inject it into your classes and set
  the current language. This part was straightforward as well.
  
* Package.php: Make the entities of Gedmo Translatable known to Doctrine and in Reflection. This was quite tricky to
  archive, see the inline docs in the class how this was done.

## Further recommendation

* Use [ORM query hints](https://github.com/doctrine-extensions/DoctrineExtensions/blob/main/doc/translatable.md#using-orm-query-hint) when working with Gedmo Translatable to speed up queries.
* Use [translation entities](https://github.com/doctrine-extensions/DoctrineExtensions/blob/main/doc/translatable.md#translation-entity) if you have large datasets with many translations.
